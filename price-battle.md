# Price Battle — Project Knowledge

## Overview
**Price Battle** is a single-file web app (`index.html`) that compares Apple product prices between Thailand (base) and 39 other countries. Users can quickly find where to buy their next Apple device at the best price.

---

## Tech Stack
- Single HTML file — no framework, no build tool
- Vanilla JS + CSS (CSS variables for theming)
- Data stored in `localStorage`
- Exchange rates fetched live from external API
- Deployed / shared as a standalone `.html` file

---

## Core Features

### 1. Price Comparison
- Select country → category → model → storage size
- Shows Thailand price vs selected country price side-by-side
- Prices stored in `CSV_PRICES` constant (keyed by product key e.g. `"iPhone - iPhone 17 Pro - 256GB"`)
- Exchange rate converts prices between THB and foreign currency

### 2. Price Difference Display
- Shows savings in foreign currency amount (e.g. "Save ¥173")
- Shows savings as percentage: formula = `(foreign - thailand) / foreign × 100`
- Green = Thailand is cheaper, Red = foreign is cheaper
- Thumbs up 👍 shown on winning side

### 3. VAT Refund (Thailand)
- Toggle on/off
- Deducts VAT refund amount from Thailand price
- Shows breakdown: base price − VAT refund = effective price
- Official Thai Tourist VAT Refund table used

### 4. Sales Tax (USA & Canada only)
- Appears below price columns when USA or Canada is selected
- User enters ZIP code (USA) or postal code prefix (Canada)
- **USA**: Looks up combined rate (state + county + city) from 922 ZIP prefixes hardcoded table. Falls back to state-only rate if prefix not found
- **Canada**: Looks up province from first letter of postal code → combined GST/HST/PST rate
- Shows: state/province name, base price, tax rate (combined or state-only), tax amount, total with tax
- Toggle "Include tax in comparison" → updates price display and diff calculation
- No external API used — fully offline/hardcoded

### 5. Store Links
- "View on Apple Store [Country]" button with direct URL
- URLs stored in `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_LINKS` (keyed by country code → product key)
- Two link buttons shown (main + alternate)

### 6. Country Notes
- Shown below comparison as bullet points
- Stored in `DEFAULT_COUNTRY_MODEL_NOTES` (keyed by country code → model key)
- Examples: "eSIM only", "Dual physical SIM (no eSIM)", "Can't turn off shutter sound"
- Notes are per model (not per storage size)

## localStorage Keys
| Key | Content |
|---|---|
| `apc_app_version` | Version string — triggers auto-clear on update |
| `apc_prices` | User-overridden prices |
| `apc_custom` | Custom added products |
| `apc_product_links` | User-overridden store URLs |
| `apc_country_model_notes` | User-edited notes |
| `apc_hidden_products` | Hidden/removed products |
| `apc_model_order` | Custom model sort order |

| `apc_lang` | Last selected language (en/th) |

> **Auto-clear**: On app load, if `apc_app_version` doesn't match the current version string, all data keys above are cleared and the new version is stored. This ensures fresh data when a new HTML file is deployed.

---

## Data Source
- Prices imported from `Master_Template_numbers.csv`
- CSV columns: product key, 40 country prices, 40 URLs, 40 country notes
- Import script (Python) parses CSV and replaces JS constants in HTML
- Notes use `|` as separator between bullet points

---

## Known Behaviours / Notes
- USA/Canada tax is **estimate only** — combined rate by 3-digit ZIP prefix, may differ slightly from Apple.com (which uses exact address-level rate)
- "State rate only" label shown when ZIP prefix not in combined table
- Percentage formula changed to `(foreign - thai) / foreign` to avoid misleadingly high numbers
- VAT Refund only applies to Thailand side
- Send Feedback → opens mail to `leng_pp2@icloud.com` with subject "Feedback: Price battle"
